General: 

A simulation that looks at the most probable electoral college difference
between Joe Biden and Donald Trump. For every one of the 128,000
trials, a corresponding electoral college difference is mapped. The probability
is then calculated that the electoral college difference lies between two values. This model is used to inform my predictit prediction. 

Assumptions: 

The model assumes that PA goes to Joe Biden and TX goes to Trump. This leaves seven toss-up states (defined as a state where the polling margin is less than 5%) remaining that are randomly assigned to either Trump or Biden with a slight favoribility toward Biden due to his average lead across the state-specific polls.
